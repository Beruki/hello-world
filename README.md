# hello-world
My first repository. Happy to be here

print("Hello Beruki")

Just finished the physics class. im not very good at physics, but it seems interesting. So just keep working and we will see

what will I have for lunch?

I'm gonna try a Chinese restaurant with my best friend Tina :)

It's always great to hang out with good friends.

Then after lunch I go home and take a sweet nap.

When I wake up, hopefully it's not late than 5pm, I will go swimming!

And do my history homework in the evening!

Good plan right? Let's hope it can go well lol

XDDDD
